## OOP 指什么？有哪些特性
>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. There is significant diversity of OOP languages, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determine their type.

## 如何通过构造函数的方式创建一个拥有属性和方法的对象?
## prototype 是什么？有什么特性
## 画出如下代码的原型图
{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
function People (name){
  this.name = name;
  this.sayName = function(){
    console.log('my name is:' + this.name);
  }
}

People.prototype.walk = function(){
  console.log(this.name + ' is walking');  
}

var p1 = new People('饥人谷');
var p2 = new People('前端');
{% endcodeblock %}
## 创建一个 Car 对象，拥有属性name、color、status；拥有方法run，stop，getStatus
## 创建一个 GoTop 对象，当 new 一个 GotTop 对象则会在页面上创建一个回到顶部的元素，点击页面滚动到顶部。拥有以下属性和方法

* `ct`属性，GoTop 对应的 DOM 元素的容器
* `target`属性， GoTop 对应的 DOM 元素
* `bindEvent` 方法， 用于绑定事件
* `createNode` 方法， 用于在容器内创建节点
